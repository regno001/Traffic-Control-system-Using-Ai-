AI-Powered Traffic Control Management System
The AI-Powered Traffic Control Management System is a project designed to revolutionize urban traffic management. It uses computer vision, real-time data analytics, and automated controls to create a dynamic, responsive, and intelligent system that improves traffic flow and public safety.

Key Features
Adaptive Signal Control: Dynamically adjusts traffic light cycles based on real-time vehicle detection and lane occupancy.

Emergency Vehicle Prioritization: Detects and responds to emergency vehicles, clearing a dedicated path to reduce response times.

Automated Violation Reporting: Uses computer vision to identify and log traffic violations, capturing images and data for authorities.

Accident Detection & SOS: Automatically detects traffic incidents and triggers an emergency protocol, sending SOS alerts and notifying emergency services.

Project Structure
The project is divided into several key components:

backend/: Contains the core logic and API.

app.py: The Flask API that manages all system communications, including data from sensors and commands to traffic lights.

frontend/: The user interface for monitoring and interacting with the system.

index.html: A single-page application (SPA) that provides a real-time, interactive dashboard.

docs/: Project documentation, including the project plan and a detailed design document.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Flask

Installation
Clone the repository:



Set up the backend:

cd backend
pip install Flask

Running the Application
Start the backend API:

python app.py

Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the frontend dashboard. The frontend will communicate with the running backend.
